802.11 Reference Design Experiments Framework (wlan_exp)

  The 802.11 Reference Design Experiments Framework provides the basic python 
communication structure for interacting with 802.11 nodes running on WARP 
hardware.  The The basic file structure:

  - node.py 
      - wlan_exp Node (WlanExpNode) is a sub-class of a WARP Node and
        provides the base class for a single WARP node running a version of
        the 802.11 reference design (either Access Point (AP), Station (STA), 
        or Ad-hoc (IBSS) node)
  - node_*.py
      - Sub-class of WlanExpNode to implement features specific to roles
        of an 802.11 node.  Currently, the framework supports Access Points
        (AP), Stations (STA), or Ad-hoc (IBSS) nodes.
  - cmds.py
      - Python definitions for each command that is communicated between 
        the python node and the 802.11 node.
  - info.py
      - Python definitions for information structures used to communicate 
        data between the host and the node.
  - util.py
      - Top level utility functions used to interact with multiple nodes


Top Level Scripts:
  - None


Notes:
    The 802.11 Reference Design Experiments Framework builds on top of the 
802.11 reference design for WARP hardware:  https://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/802.11  
to allow users to interact with nodes.

    It also utilize the transport framework for communicating with WARP 
nodes.  You can find the WARP documentation, binaries and toolchains on our 
website at http://warpproject.org/.
