//---------- COMPILATION TOGGLES ----------
//  The following toggles directly affect the size of the .text section after compilation.
//  They also implicitly affect DRAM usage since DRAM is used for the storage of
//  station_info_t structs as well as Tx/Rx logs.


#define WLAN_SW_CONFIG_ENABLE_WLAN_EXP      1       //Top-level switch for compiling wlan_exp. Setting to 0 implicitly removes
                                                    // logging code if set to 0 since there would be no way to retrieve the log.

#define WLAN_SW_CONFIG_ENABLE_TXRX_COUNTS   1       //Top-level switch for compiling counts_txrx.  Setting to 0 removes counts
                                                    // from station_info_t struct definition and disables counts retrieval via

                                                    // retrieval capabilities in wlan_exp. Note: this is logically distinct from

                                                    // all LTG-related code from the design as well we disable any wlan_exp
