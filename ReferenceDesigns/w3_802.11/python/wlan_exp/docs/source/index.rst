Mango WLAN Experiments Framework Documentation
==============================================

The Mango 802.11 Reference Design implements a framework for running experiments with multiple nodes. This 
framework enables low-level visibility and control of MAC and PHY behaviors in real time. The experiment 
framework is implemented as a Python packaged named wlan_exp.

This documentation is generated from the Python code and describes the various classes and methods
in wlan_exp. Additional details on how the experiments framework integrates with the reference C code
are in the reference design user guide: https://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/802.11/wlan_exp.

The wlan_exp code is Copyright (c)2016 Mango Communications, Inc. and is distributed under
the Mango Reference Design License (http://mangocomm.com/802.11/license).
