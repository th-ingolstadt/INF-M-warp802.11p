Mango 802.11 Reference Design Experiments Framework Documentation
=================================================================

The Mango 802.11 Reference Design implements a framework for running experiments 
with multiple nodes. This framework enables low-level visibility and control of 
MAC and PHY behaviors in real time. The experiments framework is implemented as 
a Python packaged named wlan_exp.

This documentation is generated from the Python code and describes the various 
classes and methods in wlan_exp. Additional details on how the experiments 
framework integrates with the reference C code are in the reference design 
user guide: https://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/802.11/wlan_exp.

The wlan_exp code is Copyright (c)2016 Mango Communications, Inc. and is 
distributed under the Mango Reference Design License 
(http://mangocomm.com/802.11/license).
