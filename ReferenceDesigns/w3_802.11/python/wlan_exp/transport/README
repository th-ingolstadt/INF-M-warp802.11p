Transport

  Transport provides the basic python communication structure for talking with 
WARP hardware.  The basic file structure:

  - node.py 
      - A Node encapsulates information about a single hardware board and 
        allows a user to interact with that board
  - transport*.py
      - A Transport that allows a node to communicate over a given 
        transport type.  Currently, UDP over Ethernet is the only communication
        protocol supported.
  - message.py
      - Python definitions for the packets used to communicate over the 
        transport.  You can find more information about the wire format for
        the Transport Header and Command Header at:
        https://warpproject.org/trac/wiki/WARPLab/Reference/Architecture/WireFormat
  - cmds.py
      - Python definitions for each command that is communicated between 
        the python node and the board.
  - config.py
      - Python definitions for interacting with configuration files.
  - exception.py
      - Python definitions for exceptions used within the transport
  - util.py
      - Top level utility functions used to interact with multiple nodes        


Top Level Scripts:
  - setup
      - Used to create initialization files that will set up the environment.


Notes:
    WARP is a scalable and extensible programmable wireless platform, built 
from the ground up, to prototype advanced wireless networks. You can find 
the WARP documentation, binaries and toolchains on our website at 
http://warpproject.org/.
